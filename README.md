# A*Algorithm
Small project where you can easily see and understant how the A*Algorithm would find the shortest path between two points in a grid with a fixed % of obstacles.<br>
Further information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

## Information
We have a Tablero class that has a String matrix with 60x80 dimensions. To begin with we choose a fixed % of obstacles like a 30%. Those obstacles will be represented with the * symbol. Furthermore, we have an start position represented with I and an ending position, represented with G and the goal is to implement a variant of the A* Algorithm to obtain the optimal path between these two points in the grid.

## GUI Functionality
I have updated the project and added a graphycal user interface for the user to visualize what the algorithm achieves in an easy and understandable way.
The user has to write in a label a porcentaje of obstacles between 10% and 90% and then press the "generate laberithm button":

</p>

After that, the only button enabled is the one that finds the shortest path (if there is) using the A* algorithm and prints it as you can see for instance:
