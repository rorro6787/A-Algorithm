# A*Algorithm
Small project where you can easily see and understant how the A*Algorithm would find the shortest path between two points in a grid with a fixed % of obstacles.<br>

## Information
We have a Tablero class that has a String matrix with 60x80 proportions. To begin with we choose a fixed % of obstacles like a 30%. Those obstacles will be represented with the * symbol. Furthermore, we have an start position represented with I and an ending position, represented with G and the goal is to implement a variant of the A* Algorithm to obtain the optimal path between these to points in the grid.
